  # Simple Multi-Dataset Configuration
  # Mix two datasets with custom ratios using STREAMING mode
  #
  # ‚ö° STREAMING MODE (streaming=true):
  #   - Instant loading (no upfront tokenization)
  #   - Tokenizes on-the-fly during training
  #   - Constant memory usage
  #   - Recommended for ALL multi-dataset configs
  #
  # üìù NON-STREAMING MODE (streaming=false):
  #   - Slow: tokenizes all texts upfront (minutes for 1000s of texts)
  #   - Only use for single large-text datasets (like tiny_shakespeare alone)
  #   - See config_multi_tiny.hocon for fast non-streaming example
